# Trilliant

Trilliant is a platform for services and web apps. It is in a very early form at the moment, but powers a handful of internal applications for @monroe-hardware.

# Requirements

Trilliant is currently experimental and targets Node LTS v16. This package contains only the base classes and basic utilities. Other packages include trilliant-tedious, which implements SQL Server pooling as a service module and trilliant-webserver, which adds web server functionality. The trilliant-static package is a static website builder that can be used to generate standalone sites, app user interfaces, or sites backed by services running on Trilliant.
